`nota:` `in` statement can be remplaced by `()`. Example : 

    let a = 0 in {
        print(a);
        a :=  1;
        print(a);
    }

Remplacement:

    let a = 0 ( {
        print(a);
        a :=  1;
        print(a);
    } )

so the parser will see :
    
    let a = 0 as L'
    
    then: 

       L ' in {
        print(a);
        a :=  1;
        print(a);
    }
    equivalent to:

    L '({
        print(a);
        a :=  1;
        print(a);
    })

which can be pased as `P ''`
